# Mosquito species detection using Moblenet V2 object detection alogrithm
This is a mosquito species detection web app which can detect species of mosquito using tensorflow object-detection api

# Models trained 
  - mobile net v1
  - Mobile net v2
  - Fast rcnn 


### Object detector pre-requisite library required

Mosquito detector uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [Python] - Python 3.7
* [Tensorflow] - Tensorflow-GPU (1.14.0 version)
* [Flask] - Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework

### Installation



Install the python 3.7


run installation command


$  pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0


run command


$ pip install -r requirements.txt


then run 


$ python app.py
